NAME

Time::UTC - manipulation of UTC in terms of TAI

DESCRIPTION

This module encapsulates knowledge about the structure of the UTC time
scale, including the leap seconds of the current incarnation.  This
information is useful in manipulating times stored in a UTC-based format,
or in converting between UTC and TAI (the underlying atomic time scale).
It automatically downloads new UTC data as required to keep up to date.
This is a low-level module, intended for use by other modules that need
to know about UTC.  This module aims to be comprehensive and rigorous.

INSTALLATION
