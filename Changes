  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Math::BigRat (for construction
    from decimal fraction strings)

  * after an attempted download of leap second data fails, retry after
    one to two hours, rather than the 20 to 22 days that we wait before
    attempting another update following a successful download

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * avoid latent bug of passing magic variables $1 et al into functions
    where in the future they might unexpectedly change value

version 0.005; 2007-09-17

  * bugfix: in Time::UTC, ensure that the Time::UTC::Segment that is
    loaded is recent enough to have the $SIG{__DIE__} bugfix

  * download Mills-style leap-seconds.list, which contains an explicit
    expiry date, in preference to USNO tai-utc.dat
